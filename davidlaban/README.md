## Open Source Projects

Most of my open source contributions happen on [GitHub](https://github.com/alsuren/) and are tracked on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/oUj099Rh/oss-contributions-and-other-projects), with a [WIP limit](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-wip) to stop myself going insane.

The biggest project that I own is [a home monitoring project](https://github.com/alsuren/mijia-homie/) which feeds temperature and humidity readings to Grafana.

## Presentations

I've been using [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) (specifically my [embed-all-the-things branch](https://excalidraw-git-fork-alsuren-embed-font-excalidraw.vercel.app/)) and `npx live-server` for writing my presentations recently. I quite like the workflow. So far, I have written internal presentations about:

- Some internal presentations.
- [My home monitoring project](https://alsuren.github.io/mijia-homie/docs/presentation/) for Binary Solo, and updated for Rust London.
