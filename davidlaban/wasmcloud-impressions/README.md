# Early impressions of WasmCloud

_[David Laban](../) â€” June 2021_

First impressions of technologies are quite important for driving adoption, so I've started writing down my early impressions as I explore different technologies

## Documentation

You start at wasmcloud.dev ("Docs Home"), and can follow a getting started guide from there, but there is also a "Home" link in the top bar that takes you to wasmcloud.com, which links out to a bunch of commercial courses.

## `wash`

The getting started guide recommends that you have wash set to 250 characters wide. This is a bit ridiculous. It also has a "REPL (Standalone)" thing that flashes in the top-left corner. Why? Can you please just not. Can I just run wash in a daemon mode, and inject commands into it from bash?
