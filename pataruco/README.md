## About me

[@pataruco](twitter)

Hello! I'm [Pedro](https://red-badger.com/people/pedro-martin/), I was born and raised in [Caracas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas), Venezuela 🇻🇪, I started as a Science Teacher 🧪, then jumped to a [charity](https://www.facebook.com/pazcontodoccs/) to improve social integration in the slums. I arrived in London in 2013 and worked as [rope access technician](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/20/hanging-by-thread-rats-keep-skyscrapers-standing) to save money to do a Web Development course, which I finished at General Assembly in 2015 and they were crazy enough to hire me as a Teacher Assistant. I am still teaching, now as [Lead Instructor](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/pedro-martin/7012), so the circle is completed.

The thing I like about programming is the feeling that you are creating-tinkering-building something useful for other people to use and I found a profound satisfation in teach non-technical people in how to code.

If you want to crack a laugh 🤣, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKZ0tNg9A3U) is when I was dressed as a bumblebee 🐝 in a nationally broadcasted TV 📺 commercial for Subway
