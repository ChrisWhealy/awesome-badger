excerpt: <p>Since JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, it employs a strategy called "type coercion".  This behaviour means that under certain circumstances, values of one datatype will automatically be transformed into the equivalent value of another datatype.</p><p>In this blog we take a light-hearted look at not only how and when type coercion takes place, but also some of its more unexpected consequences.</p>
