## 6: Zooming In

Now that we can dynamically plot the Julia Set for any location on the Mandelbrot Set, it would now be nice to be able to zoom in on the Mandelbrot Set.

As we zoom further in however, in order to see a reasonable level of detail, it will also be necessary to increase the maximum number of iterations.

In this particular section, we will only be changing the JavaScript and HTML coding.  Our underlying WebAssembly function does not need to change.
