## 2.2: Optimised Escape-Time Implementation

As previously implemented, the `escapeTime` function performs a brute-force version of algorithm because the loop only stops when one of our two hard limits is exceeded.  Fortunately however, it is possible to completely avoid running the expensive escape-time loop by checking whether the given point lies within either the main cardioid or the period-2 bulb.

If is does, then we already know that this value will escape to infinity and can therefore immediately colour it black.

All we need to do now is add a check that takes the (`x`,`y`) coordinates of the pixel location, and checks whether it lies within either of these two regions.

The exact implementation of these functions is not important at the moment:

```javascript
const isInMainCardioid   = (x, y) => ...
const isInPeriodTwoBulb  = (x, y) => ...
const mandelEarlyBailout = (x, y) => isInMainCardiod(x,y) || isInPeriod2Bulb(x,y)
```

One other important point is that these function must be passed the (`x`,`y`) coordinate value of the pixel, ***not*** its pixel location in the canvas.  This means that for the sake of efficiency, we need to convert the pixel location values stored in `ix` and `iy` into the coordinate space value before passing them either to the early bail out check, or the escape time algorithm itself.  Hence the calls to `pixel2XCoord` and `pixel2YCoord` have been moved out of function `escapeTime()`

Now, our more efficient loop looks like this:

```javascript
for (let iy = 0; iy < mCanvas.height; ++iy) {
  let y0 = pixel2YCoord(iy)

  for (let ix = 0; ix < mCanvas.width; ++ix) {
    let x0 = pixel2XCoord(ix)

    // Assume the colour will be black
    let colour = 0xFF000000

    // Do we have to run the escape time algorithm?
    if (!mandelEarlyBailout(x0, y0)) {
      let iter = escapeTime(x0, y0)

      if (iter !== maxIters) {
        // This pixel has some colour other than black
        colour = iter2Colour(iter)
      }
    }
  
    // Write the 4-byte colour data to the ArrayBuffer using the 32-bit overlay
    buf32[iy * mCanvas.width + ix] = colour
  }
}
```

You can examine and run the coding of this [optimized implementation](02-optimised-implementation.html)

As you can see from the rendering time, this simple check improves the response time by a factor of between 5 and 6.
