### 7.4 Adapt the Main Thread Coding

Here we need to make multiple small changes to the JavaScript coding in our HTML file, as this will now become our "main thread".

1. [Extend the HTML](./01/)
1. [Split WebAssembly Coding](./02/)
1. [Create Web Workers](./03/)
1. [Send/Receive Web Worker Messages](./04/)
1. [Adapt WebAssembly Function `mj_plot`](./05/)
