## 5: Plotting a Julia Set

Now that we have an efficient means of plotting the Mandelbrot Set, we can now add an additional HTML `canvas` element to the Web page to display a Julia Set.

For every point on the Mandelbrot Set, there is a corresponding Julia Set.  So as the mouse pointer moves over the Mandelbrot Set, a completely new Julia Set needs to be rendered.  Consequently, every time a `mousemove` event goes off over the `canvas`, our now dual-purpose escape-time algorithm will be invoked.

This is where we will start to see the benefits of writing in WebAssembly Text, because we can focus on low-level efficiency.

We need to make two sets of changes:

1. [Web Page Changes](./01/)
1. [WebAssembly Changes](./02/)

Here's a working version of the [Mandelbrot Set with Dynamic Julia Sets](mb-julia-set.html)

### How Big is the WASM Module Now?

Good question, glad you asked...  ðŸ˜ƒ

Now that we have a single WebAssembly module that can plot both the Mandelbrot and Julia Sets, it is worth looking at the size of the compiled module:

```bash
$ ll
total 56
drwxr-xr-x   8 chris  staff    256  9 Dec 19:04 .
drwxr-xr-x  10 chris  staff    320  9 Dec 18:41 ..
drwxr-xr-x   3 chris  staff     96  9 Dec 14:42 01
drwxr-xr-x   3 chris  staff     96  9 Dec 14:42 02
-rw-r--r--   1 chris  staff    894  9 Dec 16:26 README.md
-rw-r--r--   1 chris  staff   6812  9 Dec 18:25 mb-julia-set.html
-rw-r--r--   1 chris  staff    712  9 Dec 19:04 mj_plot.wasm
-rw-r--r--   1 chris  staff  11936  9 Dec 14:08 mj_plot.wat
```

Wow! Only 712 bytes!

Compare this with the 74Kb module created by `wasm-pack` from a Rust implementation mentioned in the [introduction](../).
