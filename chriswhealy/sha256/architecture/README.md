# Architecture

The architecture of the WebAssembly part of this program is laid out in the following ![block diagram](/chriswhealy/sha256/img/sha256.pdf).

This diagram borrows from Jackson Structured Programming where the pale yellow boxes represent a sequence and the blue boxes represent an interation.
The instructions in the child boxes underneath each blue box will be repeated multiple times.
