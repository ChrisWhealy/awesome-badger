## So, How Hard Do You Hit the Keyboard?

As far as the storage of information is concerned, programming languages can be divided into two basic categories:

* Languages that use ***Strong Typing***, and 
* Languages that use ***Weak Typing***

True, there are many more subtleties involved here than simply these two generic categories; but this is a good starting point for understanding.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

When people less familiar with programming hear that a language uses "strong typing", they can be forgiven for thinking that something like this is going on:

![Strong Typing?](../img/Strong%20Typing.jpg)

The terms ***strong*** or ***weak*** typing have nothing to do with how hard you hit the keys on the keyboard; instead, they refer broadly to two different, but related things:

1. How strictly the rules of datatype safety are enforced, and
1. Whether that enforcement occurs at compile-time, runtime or both


Broadly speaking languages are either:

* ***Strongly Typed***  
    A strongly typed language is one in which the compiler strictly enforces that you declare what type of data will be stored in a variable ***before*** you assign a value.
    
    The compiler is then able to trap any statements that attempt to assign a value of some other datatype.  C, C++, Java and Rust are examples of language that use strong, compile-time type enforcement rules.

* ***Weakly Typed***  
    A weakly typed language is one that doesn't care about such compile-time details &ndash; usually because these languages tend not to be compiled.  These languages are generally scripting languages that are executed interpretively.

    JavaScript, Ruby and Python are examples of interpreted scripting languages, and all of which use weak type enforcement.

## What Does It Mean to "Coerce" Something?

> ***Coerce***: Verb
> 
> To compel by force, intimidation, or authority, especially without regard for individual desire or volition

So, in the context of a programming language, who or what is being coerced?  

There are two main situations in which coercion takes place:  

1. The value stored in a variable might automatically be converted (or coerced) to some other datatype
1. The meaning of an operator might be coerced to perform a different operation than the one originally intended<br>(E.G. under certain circumstances, the binary `+` operator might stop performing arithmetic addition and start performing string concatenation)

The point here is that this conversion happens both ***automatically*** and ***silently***.  If you're not aware that such situations could take place, then you might find your code behaving in unexpected ways!

Type coercion exists as a direct consequence of weak type enforcement.  In weakly typed languages, you are allowed you to treat the data stored in a variable as if it were of some other type. (Some strongly typed languages also allow this of behaviour.)
