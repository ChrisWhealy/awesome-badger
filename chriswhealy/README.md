As a backend developer and technical specialist, my favourite languages are Rust, WebAssembly and Kotlin.
I have also used a lot of TypeScript on Node.js and more JavaScript than I can remember...

Outside work, I play the drums, do audio engineering/live streaming/post production/FoH and tinker with room acoustics (but not all at the same time...)

I also act as the UK technical facilitator for Neal Morse's [Morsefest London](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=582818961004815) concerts.
