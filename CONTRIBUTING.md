# Contributing

Awesome Badger is meant to be a place for *anyone* at Red Badger (or even outside) to publish their thoughts. The focus is on technology, but if you want to write about something else, you're absolutely welcome to.

The audience is intended to be technical and mostly interal, although the repo is public. There is no other goal than for the Red Badger tech community to share ideas and experiences with one another.

## 1. Get started

First, create a top level directory for your section of the repo. Your github or twitter handle is probably a good name. Put a `README.md` in it and maybe introduce yourself, but you don't have to. You can have a look at [Stu's profile][stu] as an example.

Next, add any writing you want to publish for others to read and add a link to the top level readme. 

## 2. Get a review (optional)

You can push straight to master if you want to, but it's probably a good idea to get someone to review your post. Just open a pull request like you would in a software project and get someone to have a look.

## 3. Have fun

That's it, have fun writing and reading your fellow Badgers' posts!

## Other things you could do

In no particular order:

* If you've got post ideas or requests, you can open an issue suggesting them. 
* Include working code alongside your writing, why not
* Add any sort of helpful automation you think is a good idea
